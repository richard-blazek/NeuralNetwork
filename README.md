# Neural network
Implementation of a neural network for deep learning, written from scratch in C.

The main program trains the network to do OCR for digits. It requires files `train-images-idx3-ubyte` and `train-labels-idx1-ubyte`,
which should be data from the MNIST database, which can be downloaded at: https://github.com/cvdfoundation/mnist.
